              Loryn&apos;s long-term product goal is for it to replace the company&apos;s Employee

              It went live in August 2025 as a proof of concept. I joined in October 2025 as the
              sole designer on the IT service management functionality, covering it end-to-end,
              and releasing it in March 2026. I was working with a client-side Experience Lead,
              and Product Lead as daily partner and a team of 7 engineers.

              categories in that data.
