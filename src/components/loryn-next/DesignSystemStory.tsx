            <BlockBody>
              When I joined, Loryn existed as an alpha-stage proof of concept — built by engineers
              on an open-source design system, with no one yet owning how it looked or behaved as
              a whole; screens differed across flows, and the same action might use three
              different button styles. My first task was narrow and urgent -- bring structure
              quickly, design systems are home ground for me, but because the product needed to
              look and feel like one coherent thing before the client would trust it enough to
              scale it.

            <BlockBody>
              Firstly, I Implemented the standard practice of three-tier hierarchy. Also Loryn
              serves for both desktop and mobile, so the UI has to be consistent by default.
              Secondly, this design system not only live in Figma, but I execute the codebase as
              well. It was entirely written by Claude code, and without explicit token contracts,
              the models hallucinate and invents its own values (like spacing, arbitrary colours).
              With this three-tier system and designsystem.md and .json files, Claude code had a
              hard contract to build against.

            <BlockBody>
              The input is the primitive everything else is built on, so it&apos;s where the
              system started. I designed and shipped it as a real component, the same field used
              across every form in the catalog. It&apos;s a controlled input: it takes a value,
              stays editable, and reports changes back. Loryn prefills the field with the
              agent&apos;s proposed value and the user edits or confirms it. Nothing fancy under
              the hood — that&apos;s the point. One shipped component, consistent everywhere,
              prefill-ready by design.

                Loryn resolves every user query through three tiers of AI involvement — from
                simple knowledge retrieval, up through offering to act on the user&apos;s behalf,
                up to full task execution — an architecture designed jointly with the client&apos;s
                Experience Lead and product owners. My part was designing what each tier actually
                looks and feels like, and deciding which interaction pattern each tier deserved,
                which produced two real patterns and one real trade-off.

                A structured panel sitting beside the chat, used for anything reaching full task
                execution — complex, high-stakes requests where a user needs to verify data at a
                glance before it submits anywhere. This shipped, and the full story of how it
                works in practice lives in the Agentic Workflows tab.

                A lighter concept for low-complexity tasks — correcting a small piece of
                AI-returned data directly inside the chat, no separate panel required. We
                designed it, then deprioritized it: one pattern everywhere was cheaper to build
                and maintain than two, and I took that trade genuinely, not reluctantly. The
                reopening condition was simple — if friction on small tasks ever showed up as a
                real complaint, the concept was already documented and ready. It never did, which
                told me the original call was right.

            <BlockBody>
              Rather than handing engineering static mockups, I set up a workflow using Cursor to
              prototype system components directly in code — building the Form Panel pattern as
              something that actually ran, with real states and behavior, before engineering
              picked it up. That meant validating interaction decisions against reality earlier,
              and handing off something engineers could react to rather than annotate.

            <BlockBody>
              Once the Form Panel pattern existed, it didn&apos;t need to be reinvented per use
              case — the same pattern was extended across 29 forms, ranging from low to high
              complexity, each new use case a matter of applying an existing decision, not
              relitigating it. That&apos;s the actual measure of whether a design system is
              working: not how many components exist, but how much cheaper each new thing gets to
              design.
